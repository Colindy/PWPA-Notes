### HTTP & DNS

HTTP is a request/response protocol.  This is stateless (does not keep memory of prior requests.  This dicates the use of cookies to keep information from session to session, like a shopping cart or website settings and preferences)

HTTP Methods  
GET - Used to get information from a server  
POST - Used to submit data to the server  
PUT - Used to update a resource  
DELETE - Used to delete a resource

HTTP Response Codes - i.e. 200 OK  (These can be changed by the developer if they want)
1xx: Informational  
2xx: Successful  
3xx: Redirection  
4xx: Client Error  
5xx: Server Error  

DNS ties IP addresses to their domain name (yahoo.com, google.com, etc)  
Top-Level Domain - .com, .gov, .edu, etc  
Second Level Domain - yahoo, google, tcmsec, etc  
Sub Domain - www (generally) or other items before the Second Level Domain  

DNS Records  
A - Domain name to an IPv4 Address  
AAAA - Domain name to an IPv6 Address  
MX - Mail server for a domain name  
CNAME - An alias for a domain name
