### Introduction to APIs (Application Programing Interface)

Makes it possible to have webpages interact without refreshing the whole page.

Basically the API returns raw data and you use the application to do whatever you want with that data.

This course didn't go very deep into it, hopefully the PWPP will have more API focused material.
